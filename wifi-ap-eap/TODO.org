* DONE change shared secret for hostapd/radius
  - and store it in a secure location for hostapd
  - we could auto-generate this
  - hostapd doesn't seem to have any way to put the secret in a different file
* DONE auto-generate certificates
  - add options for setting certificate options, e.g. name
  - auto-generate certificates
  - store them in /var/lib/freeradius ?
    -> probably not; where are the SSH private keys? -> /etc/ssh
* DONE automatically enable 4-address mode if requested
* DONE add script to generate user cert
  - similar to the script for task server
  - also generate pfx file for android:
    - openssl pkcs12 -export -in daniela@laptop.pem -out daniela@laptop.pfx -passin pass:x -passout pass:x
    - Can we use the .p12 file?
      -> yes, but ca file needs .crt extension
* DONE accounting shouldn't use user name for client cert
  -> workaround: force user name to match certificate
* WONTFIX add option for putting the users file in another place
  - radius group must have access and the user cannot do that before the group exists
  - We can copy the file to the statedir - on start and reload.
  - We cannot easily add this for reload so let the user do it - that way, she knows
    about the imperfections.
* DONE How is the structure of the certificates?
  - In particular: If client certificates are also signed by the CA - what stops them from impersonating
    the server? Clients can check the common name but the default is to not do that.
  - I think the type of the certificate is different - the config file either has [client]
    or [server].
  - From the generated certificate files (02.pem vs. 05.pem):
      X509v3 extensions:
        X509v3 Extended Key Usage: 
    -     TLS Web Server Authentication
    +     TLS Web Client Authentication
* WONTFIX fix 4addr mode
  - I cannot set this while the interface is already active and we have to enable WDS mode
    if we want to use it.
  - http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/hostap/2016-May/035670.html
  - https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/documentation/iw#setting_up_a_wds_peer
  - Ok, this is complicated and I have no use for it right now.
  - I will remove the option, for now.
* DONE revocation
  - https://jamielinux.com/docs/openssl-certificate-authority/certificate-revocation-lists.html
  - https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/FreeRadius_EAP-TLS_configuration
  - works as expected: revoked certificate cannot be used anymore
  - We can only revoke a certificate if we still have the file; but OpenSSL is keeping them anyway.
  - Well, ok, not quite - it doesn't work for my second test.
  - What do we have to do for a revocation to become active?
  - https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/ticket/623?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=d2ab2ea022d2991016710bf0cc28a6547e099963-1587268160-0-ASGtk8kPjK3AQmHGs7B2azUY6sRsncqiEn39xwJnZ_p9zICeLTpTcgd8MUZluBOIWh1oc9OaPLNo04TGYt8-7ueWqKQ4FKyMBduBHfbx31Yp225pR82-7w_pufFbSyQP7d_OyFPF5FKSJwqtE2L8qJf0MIJihyFmIPW3Y22UE_oprWU3X7CLsQQwYodtNPcJSReYSe823udBoMmr9Nclh8EMdB9ET-i0c6LjNwxe0jA_xgNF7cy9jclfMhaepsYQwPLXgt5rpZyr_Ze0cWZp-6z2KmfYfIUjkvNJGSBi0pZR
  - This confirms my suspicion: Revocation is active after a restart but reload doesn't help.
  - It does work if we increment the index in the filename.
* DONE cleanup old files in tlscache
  - This command is suggested in the example config: find ${logdir}/tlscache -mtime +2 -exec rm -f {} \;
* WONTFIX don't split options, i.e. don't use services.hostapd?
  - option 1: copy services.wifi-ap-eap.hostapd to services.hostapd if enabled
  - option 2: don't enable services.hostapd; copy the relevant parts to our .nix files
* DONE test systemd config
  - Systemd has the very annoying feature that it ignores unknown keys in config files. I get why they
    do this and this can often be useful for backward compatible unit files. However, it often masks
    errors in the files. The infamous example is "User = 0day".
  - I just learned that there is a command to check unit files. It can be applied to all of them like that:
    find -L /etc/systemd/{system,user} -type f ! -name "*.conf" -exec systemd-analyze verify {} \+
  - There are some false positives:
    - emergency.service tries to start plymouth but errors are masked with "-".
    - Lots of man pages don't exist. We probably don't care, i.e. having the reference in the unit file is
      still useful even if we don't install that man page.
  - Furthermore, we usually want to check a config before applying it and we need to do so in the right
    context, e.g. don't complain that "foo" cannot be started if it is present in the new system but not
    the old one.
  - There remaining errors are:
    systemd-journal-gatewayd.socket: Unit has no Listen setting (ListenStream=, ListenDatagram=, ListenFIFO=, ...). Refusing.
    Unit systemd-journal-gatewayd.socket has a bad unit file setting.
      -> mostly empty, should probably be missing alltogether
    clean-mount-point@i.service: Failed to create clean-mount-point@i.service/start: Unit i.mount not found.
      -> I don't think this is ever referenced with instance="i" but systemd mis-interprets the empty instance name
         and checks "Before=i.mount" instead of "Before=%i.mount".
    syslog.socket: Service syslog.service not loaded, syslog.socket cannot be started.
      -> I think the socket shouldn't exist if the service is not active.
      -> The service is gated by services.rsyslogd.enable. The socket is always part of upstreamSystemUnits in systemd.nix.
  - find -L result/etc/systemd/{system,user} -type f ! -name "*.conf" ! -name "*@.*" -exec systemd-analyze verify {} \+ 2>&1|grep -v man
  - Point in case for using a chroot/mount namespace: I had tested my script with three result links. The first one had
    a correct hostapd.service, the second one had the bug and the third one was an old one without hostapd. The script
    was correct for the first two but it was reporting the error for the third one - presumably because it was also
    looking at files of my current system.
* WONTFIX missing network interfaces shouldn't delay boot
  - I have looked through lots of .nix files and I still don't know how to do that...
  - Can we at least do this for the wifi? -> I don't know

* DONE don't use inner-tunnel directly?
CLOSED: [2020-05-02 Sat 20:16]
- https://wiki.freeradius.org/guide/eduroam
- This says that hostapd should send requests to the default virtual host, which forwards to the eap module,
  which in turn forwards to inner-tunnel if necessary (e.g. for TTLS).
- I should try that.
- The default site is already enabled so I only have to change the port.
- I think that should also get rid of the error message that was logged for rejected auth.
* DONE Am I using modern, fast wifi?

- https://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/plain/hostapd/hostapd.conf
- hw_mode only enables b/g/a. We need ieee80211n and probably ht_capab.
- My card doesn't support much of ht_capab according to `iw list`.
- The example has `wme_enabled=1` which should be "Wireless Multimedia Extensions".
  The example hostapd.conf has `wmm_enabled=1` which is probably the same thing.
  `wme_enabled=1` seems to work - at least it doesn't cause any error.
- "20/40 MHz operation not permitted on channel pri=7 sec=11 based on overlapping BSSes"
- Fixed by `ht_capab=[HT40-]` because the other SSIDs are on higher channels.
- That makes it *much* slower: 0-4 Mbit instead of 70/30 Mbit for

* DONE off-topic: weird setting of TMPDIR/TEMPDIR
CLOSED: [2020-05-02 Sat 22:47]
- `nix-shell -p openssl` has all of TEMPDIR, TEMP, TMPDIR, TMP set to /run/user/0.
- A normal shell doesn't have that. `mktemp` creates files in /tmp.
- That difference means that emacsclient won't work in nix-shell because it tries to
  connect to the wrong socket.
* DONE put clients into different VLANs
CLOSED: [2020-05-03 Sun 01:43]
- How do we add additional attributes when using certificates? Can we do that in the users file anyway?
- What do we have to do to make VLANs work? Can we do something other than VLANs, e.g. bridge some users
  to ethernet and others to a private bridge for VMs?
- This is how to apply additional attributes with SQL:
  https://wiki.freeradius.org/modules/Rlm_sql
  https://linuskarlsson.se/blog/radius-authentication-and-dynamic-vlan-assignment-for-wpa2-enterprise-using-sqlite-in-freeradius/
- We should be able to do this in /etc/wifi-ap-eap/users, though.
- Test it: Make a service that is only accessible from a certain VLAN/interface.
  - socat TCP-LISTEN:1235,fork EXEC:"echo blub"
  - #iptables -I INPUT -i wifiap.2 -p tcp --dport 1235 -j ACCEPT  --> will not work because packets come from br0
  - ebtables -I INPUT --in-if wifiap.2 -j mark --set-mark 2 --mark-target CONTINUE
  - iptables -I INPUT -i br0 -p tcp --dport 1235 -m mark --mark 2/2 -j ACCEPT
  - nc 192.168.1.23 1235
- I could also try using the sqlite database for that. This might come in handy if I ever make a tool to
  interface with the database, e.g. the admin can assign groups and VLANs in a web UI.
  - insert into radusergroup('username', 'groupname') values ('test1', 'testgroup');
  - insert into radgroupreply('groupname', 'attribute', 'op', 'value') values
      ('testgroup', 'Tunnel-Type', ':=', '13'), ('testgroup', 'Tunnel-Medium-Type', ':=', '6'), ('testgroup', 'Tunnel-Private-Group-ID', ':=', '"42"');
  - nixos-wifi-ap-eap client test test1.zip
  - That is looking good. SQL seems to win over the users file.
  - tcpdump -i wifiap.42 icmp
  - on the wifi station: ping example.com
- One might want explicit entries for some of the VLANs in the vlan_file: Otherwise, hostapd will remove
  the interfaces if no client is using it anymore and that may be annoying, e.g. an active tcpdump on that
  interface will be aborted.
