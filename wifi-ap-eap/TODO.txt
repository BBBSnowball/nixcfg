- change shared secret for hostapd/radius
  - and store it in a secure location for hostapd
  - we could auto-generate this
  - hostapd doesn't seem to have any way to put the secret in a different file
- auto-generate certificates
  - add options for setting certificate options, e.g. name
  - auto-generate certificates
  - store them in /var/lib/freeradius ?
    -> probably not; where are the SSH private keys?
- add script to generate user cert
  - similar to the script for task server
  - also generate pfx file for android:
    - openssl pkcs12 -export -in daniela@laptop.pem -out daniela@laptop.pfx -passin pass:x -passout pass:x
    - Can we use the .p12 file?
- accounting shouldn't use user name for client cert
- missing network interfaces shouldn't delay boot
- publish the config somewhere
- maybe add something that creates graphs from accounting data
  - bandwidth per day/hour; total and per device/user
- revocation
