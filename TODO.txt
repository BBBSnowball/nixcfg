  - Synapse 1.14 has been released on May 28th.
- DONE mautrix-telegram
  - I think this has some local changes, e.g. not forwarding messages with some special marker.
  - Update to 0.7.2.
- DONE HTTPS on federation port
  - Versions before 1.0 were accepting keys by trust on first sight.
  - They have changed that: https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md
  - It seems that I have already fixed it though: Port 8448 is redirected to port 443 on mailinabox, which does
    HTTPS offloading.
- DONE matrix_edi.py
  - This is using password login which we have to disable due to bugs in Riot.
  - Can we use an access token, instead?
    -> yes
- TODO Update mautrix-telegram
